llm.py -- local grounded generation with Ollama + qwen2.5vl:3b.

Verified against the installed runtime (Ollama 0.33.1): POST /api/generate
with stream=false and base64 images in the `images` array performs real
local image understanding.

Two measured constraints shape the calls made here:
  * ~1030 prompt tokens per image, so num_ctx is raised to 8192 and at most
    one image is ever attached to a query.
  * Ollama unloads after 5 minutes idle, costing a ~14s reload, so every
    call passes an explicit keep_alive.

The model is a writer, not a source of truth. It never emits citation
markers; citations are built programmatically in citations.py.

Rules you must follow without exception:
1. Use ONLY the evidence provided below and any attached image. You have no other knowledge.
2. Never invent facts, figures, dates, or names that are not in the evidence or image.
3. Never write citation markers such as [1] or (Source 2). Citations are
   attached automatically after you answer.
4. Never invent page numbers, timestamps, or filenames.
5. Copy every number, percentage, date, and proper noun EXACTLY as written in
   the evidence. Do not round, reformat, or add digits. If the evidence says
   "99.4 percent", write "99.4 percent" and never "99.44".
6. If the provided evidence and the attached image do not answer the question, say exactly:
   INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE
7. If two pieces of evidence conflict, say so explicitly and describe both
   rather than silently picking one.
8. Prefer direct evidence over loosely related evidence.
9. Be concise: at most one short paragraph unless the question needs more.

   to the user's material.
2. Name the source files and say what kind of material each one is (report
   page, spreadsheet row, dashboard image, audio segment).
3. Use ONLY the evidence below and the attached image. Never invent sources or content.
4. Copy numbers, percentages and dates EXACTLY as written. Never round or
   add digits.
5. Never write citation markers such as [1]. Citations are attached

6. Do NOT answer INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE when evidence is present -- listing
